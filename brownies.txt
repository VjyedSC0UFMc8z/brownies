COCONUT OIL BROWNIES
Yield: 16 brownies

INGREDIENTS:
2 ounces bittersweet chocolate, melted
1/2 cup virgin coconut oil
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda

DIRECTIONS:
Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Line an 8x8-inch baking pan with foil or
parchment paper, leaving an overhang on two sides.

In a large bowl combine the melted chocolate, coconut oil, granulated
sugar, brown sugar, eggs, and vanilla. Add the flour, cocoa powder,
salt, and baking soda and stir until just combined. Pour the batter into
the prepared baking pan and bake for about 20 minutes or until the
brownies are set but still moist.

Let cool completely before cutting into squares and serving. Brownies
may be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3
days.
